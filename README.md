# data-visualization
This script will load a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, and then plot a bar chart using seaborn. You'll need to replace 'data.csv', 'x_column', and 'y_column' with your own CSV file and column names. Note that the matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas Python packages are required to run this script.
